      <h2 id="Hospital">The Hospital</h2>
        <p>Prince County Hospital is a 104-bed community hospital in Summerside,
        Prince Edward Island. Our medical staff of 50 physicians is composed of the
        most likeable and friendly people you would find anywhere. PCH is well-equiped
        with the most up-to-date medical technology(including a comprehensive electronic
        health record system), thanks to generous comunity support through our
        <a href="https://pchcare.com">PCH Foundation.</a></p>
      <h2 id="Jobs">The Jobs</h2>
        <p>Our current medical manpower priority is to replace two recently-departed
        anesthesiologists. With a full anesthesia complement, on-call responsibilities
        would be one-in-three; this includes covering an OR with three general surgeons,
        three obsetricians, and one ENT surgeon; it also includes backing up our nine
        Emergency Room Physicians, who see over 30,000 ED visits per year. Visiting
        orthopedic and plastic surgeons from Charlottetown perform elective OR
        work. Canadian Royal College certification is expected. </p>
      <h2 id="The City">The City</h2>
        <p><a href="https://summerside.ca">Summerside</a> is a city of 15,000 and is
        located in picturesque <a href="https://www.tourismpei.com/">Prince Edward
        Island</a>. Known as "Canada's Food Island," PEI's traditional occupations
        of potato farming and lobster fishing are but a fraction of its increasingly
        diverse population and economy. Summerside is known for its aggressive
        promotion of hosting concert entertainers and sporting events, its encouragement of green
        energy (40% of the city's energy comes from wind and solar power), and its large and generous
        volunteer population. Its most famous export is its people, including two-time
        Olympic Gold medalist Heather Moyse, as well as NHL hockey coaches Gerard Gallant and
        Doug MacLean. Its unique <a href="https://collegeofpiping.com">College of Piping</a>
        is known worldwide for teaching and hosting Celtic performers. Local real
        estate is among the most affordable in the country. Local schools feature
        instruction in English, French or French immersion. </p>
      <h2 id="Life on PEI">The Island Life</h2>
        <p>No wonder <a href="https://www.tourismpei.com/">tourism</a> is an important
        Island industry: PEI has great beaches, golf courses, food and music festivals;
        Islanders take all of this for granted, and more - Summerside has
        one of the newest and most up-to-date recreational facilities in the Maritimes,
        <a href="http://www.cupevents.ca/">Credit Union Place</a>. The <a
        href="https://www.tourismpei.com/pei-confederation-trail">Confederation Trail</a>
        is the part of the Trans-Canada Trail that stretches across the entire length of
        the Island - it is ideal for walking, jogging, hiking, and biking. <a
        href="http://www.harbourfronttheatre.com/">Harbourfront Theater</a> is
        Summerside's own venue for the performing arts.</p>
